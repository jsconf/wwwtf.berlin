## Transport

Public transportation is pretty good in The Netherlands, you can easily get to most places by train, bus or tram. The center of Amsterdam is not that big, so it's walkable.


### Public transportation – OV-Chipkaart

In The Netherlands, they use a chip card in public transportation. Locals use a card that you can top up, but it costs you €7,50 once and always needs to have at least €20,- on the card to be able to travel with the train.

If you don't travel a lot with public transport in The Netherlands, you can buy a single-use chip cards. It's a bit more expensive, but easier to use.

### Public transportation – train
You can buy a single-use chip card for the train at one of the NS ticket machines. They are the yellow machines on the train stations. You enter your destination and you can pay with cash, debit card or credit card. Payment types depend on the machine, some machines don't have the option to pay with cash.

### Public transportation – tram / bus / metro
If you want to travel by tram, bus or underground metro, you can buy a one-hour card or a (multi-)day card. 

Most tickets can be bought from the conductor or driver on the tram, or bus or at the ticket machine at a metro station. One-day or two-day tickets cannot be bought on the bus. Three-day or four-day tickets can only be bouht at the ticket machines at the metro.

Credit cards are less common in The Netherlands, so it's not accepted everywhere (especially not outside of Amsterdam). So make sure you ask if they accept credit card before ordering any food.
